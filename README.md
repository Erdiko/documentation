## Contributing to the documentation

All of the markdown files are in the docs folder. To update an existing page simply edit the *.md file.  To add a new page create a new .md file and put in it the docs folder.  To get it to show up in the main menu you need to edit the mkdocs.yml file.  That's all you need to get going.
