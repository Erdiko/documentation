# User Admin

**erdiko/user-admin package**

Installation:

    composer create erdiko/user-admin

## Intro

This is what it does...

## Docker (Quick Start)

The easiest, and recommended, way to get start is to use Docker.  The instructions assume you have Composer, Docker, & Docker Compose already installed on your machine.

To start your environment do the following.

    composer create erdiko/user-admin
    cd user-admin
    docker-compose up -d

If you are on a PC or mac, the easiest way to install Docker and Docker Compose is to install the [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox) on your computer.  It will also install Kitematic and Machine.

## Default Login

If you followed the quick start above, it will create a sample admin user for you.  You can login with the following credentials.

user: erdiko@arroyolabs.com
pass: password
