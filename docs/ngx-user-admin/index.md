## Intro

ngx-user-admin is a npm package designed for use with the Erdiko User Admin Module but is easily extended for use in other projects. Secured with routing guards and JWT tokens, this package is a great start (or end) for secure user management.

The UI relies upon the Twitter Bootstrap / ngx-bootstrap projects and is easily modified for customization by extending the components.
