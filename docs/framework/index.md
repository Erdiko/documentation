This command will download and install a fresh copy of Erdiko in a new project-name folder within your current directory. Then, you can move to next step to [Setup web environment](#setup)


#### Via Github

* Step #1: [Download Erdiko](#download)
* Step #2: [Setup web environment](#setup)

<div id = "setup"></div>

Setup web environment
---------------------

1. Open the config file of your web server

2. Change the webroot to `[local erdiko code path]/public`

3. Create a folder named var in  `[local erdiko code path]/` and change the group of the `/var` folder to `www-data` using chgrp www-data
   `[local erdiko code path]/var`

4. Save changes and restart your web server.

5. Type http://localhost into your browser (or your virtual host name)

6. If you can see the Hello world page, you have successfully installed Erdiko!

<div class="alert alert-dismissable alert-warning">
  <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert">×</button>
  <h4>Warning!</h4>
  <p>If you cannot open the Hello world page, go back to the config file of your web server to check if the port is 80.  If the port is other than 80, you need to specify the port in Step 4. For example, if you port is 8080, the URL link will be http://localhost:8080 .</p>
</div>

<div class="alert alert-dismissable alert-info">
	<button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert">×</button>
	<strong>Heads up!</strong>
	<p>
		All of your server side application code should go in the /app folder while any js file, css file or asset should go in the /public folder.
	</p>
	<p>Theme files go in the /public folder while view files and application code goes in the /app folder. Do not modify files in /vendor/erdiko/* if you want to maintain an easy upgrade path with Erdiko.</p>
